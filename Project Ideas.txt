   -------------------------*/

2 PERSON TEAMS

 Project Propsal: 2 page proposal -- DUE WED NOV 5

 Status Report: 4 pages -- DUE MON NOV 24

 Project Presentation/Design Review: 10-15 min -- STARTS MON NOV 24
     

 Project Demonstration: 30 min session -- DUE WED DEC 10
     Don't be late it can cost a letter grade (or 2)

 Final Report:
     Can not be longer than 12 pages (appendices are not counted towards the 12 pages) 
         Appendices include source code - can point to github link or turn in online
     If we develop techniques to do things, we can submit those too


 USE GIT. OR GITHUB... ETC. IT WILL BE HELPFUL :D 
     It can help with merging and updating information when we all work on it separately
     Free hosting and documentation for GitHub


 Potential Partners: 
     Sebastian: Digital Synthesizer
         Using FPGA to determine frequency
         Synth and PIC to determine duration
         Button presses for the different kind of waves
         FPGA -> PORT -> DAC -> PIC   > so that we can use values between 0 and 1
         DAC or resistor ladder
         3D print push buttons as a keyboard
         Potentiometer - pressure signal.... analog... digital... coverters... 
         ADC on the PIC -> see if it is usable
         Problems that we could encounter: 
             Debouncing (if we use just metal contact)
             I/O pins (how to bundle things together efficiently)
             8-16 pins between FPGA and PIC for frequency
             2 pins for determining which wave
             4-8 pins for the DAC -> speaker
             8-16 pins for actual synth input
